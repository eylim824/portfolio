                Hello! I'm Esther Lim and I am studying advertising wanting to persure 
                my career in social media marketing and media advertisment. When I started
                my first CSS class, I was really unsure about it because I have never done 
                any sort of coding before. Later on after practicing and creating many projects,
                I really found CSS to be really interesting. I enjoyed learnig how to create my
                own websites and I do think I find it useful for my futher career with Business and Advertising.
